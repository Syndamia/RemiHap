# RemiHap

RemiHap is a device that reminds you to take your pills. Put a type of pill in one of five dispensers, set up how often you need to take it and you are done. When it's time, the dispenser will dispense the pill and activate an alarm until you pick it up.

This is an exam project for IT-kariera Module 8 (Introduction to operating systems and embeded systems). The hardware is made in `TinkerCad` and the software (for the microcontrollers) is written in `C++`.
